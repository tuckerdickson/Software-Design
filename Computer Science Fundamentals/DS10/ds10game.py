# assignment your job will be to make several changes that will make the game better.
#
# It uses many global variables, which is usually not good practice but is a quick way to get
# started learning tkinter/GUI programming.

# TO RUN THIS:
# 1) load into python.
# 2) type startGameGUI(6)    (or some number other than 6)
#     in the Python interpreter
# 3) after that, you can enter a number into the form in the window and click the Check It! button
#    to see if that's the right number
#

# Randomly choose number in between 1 and maxPossibleValue (inclusive)
# as the number to be guessed by the player.
# Also: set window title to indicate player should guess between 1 and that max 
#       set status lable to indicate no guesses have been made yet
#       set button text to say "Check It!"
#

    statusLabel.configure(text="You haven't made any guesses yet")
    button1.configure(text="Check It!", command=checkGuess)

# Read number entered into GUI by player, check whether it's correct, and
# give appropriate feedback in the statusLabel
