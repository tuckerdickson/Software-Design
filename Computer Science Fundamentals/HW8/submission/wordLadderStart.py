# representing a ladder between the start word and end word.
#
# For example, if the start word was "cat" and the end word was "dog", after bfs
# we might find that "dog"'s parent was "dot" and then that "dot"'s parent was
# "cot" and finally that "cot"'s parent was "cat" (which has no parent).  Thus,
# a ladder from "cat" to "dog" is ["cat", "cot", "dot", "dog"]

# Return [] if the endNode has no parent.  If the end node has no parent, the
# the breadth first search could not reach it from the start node. Thus, there
# is no word ladder between the start and end words.
