    similar to what we did in class week4 with the 'add' function.

    Be careful not to call 'log' in your code below, because this is
    a different function, from the Prelude.

    Note that lg and fmap for Logging are covered by just one test
    in PublicTests.hs (so you need to solve both to get points for
    these).

{- The functions rle and rleh below implement run-length encoding.

   Run-length encoding is a basic data-compression algorithm that
   summarizes runs of length n of a repeated element x as just the
   pair (n,x).  Run rle on some example lists to see what it is doing.

   Your job is to implement the rlelh function below, to be similar
   to rleh, but in the Logging functor, with the following log messages:

   -- "base" for the base case
   -- "change" for when we enter the else branch in the second equation -}
