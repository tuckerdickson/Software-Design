module Exercises1 where
import Extralib

import Accum

{- given an expression e, extract all the variable definitions from it.

   In more detail: return a list of all pairs (x,e) where there is a Let-expression
   in e defining x to be e.  Replace all those Let-expressions with their bodies.
   The list should be in the order Lets are encountered as you recurse down into
   the term, recursing first into in the left subexpression of an Add or Mult,
   and then into the right subexpression.

   Note that you do need to perform this replacement on e1 in an expression
   of the form Let x e1 e2.  This is a tiny bit tricky, so there is a second
   test for it in PublicTests ("extractLets 2").

   I have this set up using the Accum monad, which works very elegantly here.
